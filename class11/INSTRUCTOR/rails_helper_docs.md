# Rails Helpers

Use the following Rails documentation to DRY up your apps...

## Path and URL helpers

Instead of using `<a>` tags, we can use use the `link_to` helper in Rails. Read more about it here:

* [ActionView Helpers](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to)

Also, instead of writing out all of our paths by hand, we can use path helpers to refer to our paths:

* [Generating Paths and URLs from Code](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#generating-paths-and-urls-from-code)

You can view a list of all your routes by typing `rake routes` into your terminal.

You can learn more about rake routes and routing from this blog post that PJ (GA-NYC) wrote:

## Strong Params

To prevent mass-assignment, we use strong parameters when accepting data into our model:

## Form Helpers

You can use form helpers to help DRY up your forms. In particular, focus on the `form_for` helper.
