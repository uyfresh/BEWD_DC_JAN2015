# Private Env Variables

## Why Env Variables?

### The problem:

We frequently have private configuration data (API keys, login credentials, etc) that we don't want to include in our project codebase that gets hosted on GitHub.

### The solution

We should configure this sensative data within our host environment, and then just include references to this configuration within our project code.

## Setting it up

We're effectively just trying to add these environment variables into our bash profile; as such, we *could* just add this data into the `.bash_profile` of our user account.

However, this is putting a lot of project-specific settings into your global user configuration, which is generally bad form and can create configuration conflicts between projects. A better solution is to provision a `.env` file on a per-project basis that configures the application environment while launching it. It's easy…

### 1. Install an environment config gem

In `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'dotenv-rails', :groups => [:development, :test]
```

In bash:

```
bundle install
```

### 2. Create a ".env" file for project settings

In your root project directory, do:

```
touch .env
subl .env
```

Within your .env file, add all of your sensitive environment variables:

```
S3_BUCKET_NAME=my-private-bucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### 3. Add ".env" to Git-ignore

Lastly, we need to tell Git to ignore our environment configuration file so that it won't be included in our repo. Again, really simple:

```
 ls -la

 # Does a file called .gitignore already exist? If not, create it!
 touch .gitignore

 # Edit the Git-ignore file
 subl .gitignore
```

Within the `.gitignore` file, add your ".env" file…

```
.env
```

### 4. Reference environment variables in your app!

You'll need to restart your Rails server. Now whenever you perform a Rake task, your environment settings will be added into the environment instance. After that, you can refence environment variable within your Rails codebase through the `ENV` hash:

```
config.paperclip_defaults = {
   :storage => :s3,
   :s3_credentials => {
     :bucket => ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME'],
     :access_key_id => ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
     :secret_access_key => ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
   }
 }
```
